# Numerical Practical on the transport of a scalar

The goal of this practical is to improve your understanding on how a
numerical code integrate in time the transport equation of a scalar

```math
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}
+ \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot(\mathbf{u}\,q) = 0
```

written in flux form. The integration is done in a two-dimensional
domain, using a prescribed, time independant, incompressible flow.
